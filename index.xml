      <description>Hello Everyone this is my first ever blog post in my website! I want to tell you guys that I really enjoyed this class and learned a lot from it. Hope you all have a wonderful day!
I learned a lot about python, one thing I learned was to combine lists using python! AS well as choosing as specific character in the list.
list1 = [1,2,3,4,5] list2 = [1,5,6,7,7] list3= list1 + list2 list3 ## [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 5, 6, 7, 7] list3[3] ## 4 Here is an example of using reticulate to display the interaction between R and Python!</description>

      <description>Project 2: Modeling, Testing, Predicting The dataset that we are going to model and test looks into the test score data and income in California Schools in different counties across California. Some of the variables that we will take into account include County, District Average income(in 1,000 USD), average reading score, average math score, and number of computers. A categorical variable (County) is include with 6 groups, a total of 97 observations for Average reading score in schools in a specific county, a total of 97 observations of Average math score in schools in a specific county, and 97 observations of total number of computers in schools in a county.</description>
