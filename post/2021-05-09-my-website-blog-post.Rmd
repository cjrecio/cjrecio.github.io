Hello Everyone this is my first ever blog post in my website! I want to tell you guys that I really enjoyed this class and learned a lot from it. Hope you all have a wonderful day! 


I learned a lot about python, one thing I learned was to combine lists using python! AS well as choosing as specific character in the list.
```{python}
list1 = [1,2,3,4,5]
list2 = [1,5,6,7,7]

list3= list1 + list2
list3

list3[3]
```
Here is an example of using reticulate to display the interaction between R and Python!

```{r}
library(reticulate)
myname <- "Cesar"
```
```{python}
#Access R defined objects with R
lastname ="Recio"
print(r.myname,lastname)
```
```{r}
#Access Python defined objects with py$
cat(c(myname,py$lastname))
```
